# Biodiversity Analysis of UN National Parks

This project analyzes biodiversity data from four United States National Parks to uncover hidden trends, explore species diversity, and evaluate conservation statuses.

## Dataset Overview
- **`species_info.csv`**: Contains species' scientific names, categories (e.g., Mammals, Birds, Reptiles), and conservation statuses.
- **`observations.csv`**: Tracks the number of species observations across different parks over a seven-day period.

## Goals
1. Identify trends in species diversity and conservation statuses.
2. Analyze the distribution of rare versus common species across parks.
3. Visualize key insights about biodiversity and species distribution.

## Key Findings
### Conservation Status Breakdown
- Distribution of species across conservation categories (Endangered, Recovered, Threatened) was analyzed.
- A colorful pie chart was created with a clear key indicating the percentage for each status.

### Rare vs. Common Species
- Species categorized as "Rare" or "Common" were compared across parks.
- A bar chart revealed the distribution of rare species, highlighting biodiversity challenges in specific parks.

### Park-wise Species Observations
- Observations of species were aggregated by park.
- Insights on which parks have the highest biodiversity based on observation counts were visualized through vibrant bar plots.

## Additional Insights
- **Species Category Analysis**: Explored the distribution of species across categories (e.g., Mammals, Birds, Reptiles).
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated potential relationships between species categories and their conservation statuses.
- **Observations Overlap**: Identified shared and unique species across parks, providing insights into ecological niches.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Bright and colorful data visualizations.
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based coding environment.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and upload the datasets (`species_info.csv` and `observations.csv`) to your workspace.
2. Run the provided Python scripts in Google Colab or any Python IDE.
3. Generate visualizations and reports for further exploration.

## Future Directions
- Perform deeper statistical analysis on species distributions.
- Explore seasonal trends in observations.
- Extend the analysis to include environmental and climate factors affecting biodiversity.
